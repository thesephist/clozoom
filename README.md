# Clozoom 🎥

Inspired by [this Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/phillipHbh/status/1296200573025312768), **Clozoom** is a browser extension to close your Zoom meeting tabs automatically after they've opened Zoom. With Clozoom, your Zoom attendee tabs automatically close 3 seconds after you open them, unless you cancel.

## The real story behind Clozoom

_SCENE._

**Skype. Facetime. WebEx. Hangouts.**

Long ago, these four video chat apps lived together in harmony. Then, everything changed when **Zoom** was born. Zoom wrecked havoc on all of our browser tabs as it slowly proliferated all human interaction on Earth and never cleaned up after itself. Only Clozoom, the master of Zoom attendee tabs, could stop it, but when the world needed it most, it never came.

Many moons passed and I built **Clozoom**, a tab-bending Chrome extention. Although its tab-bending skills are great, it has a lot to learn before it's ready to save anyone.

But I believe Clozoom can save the world.
